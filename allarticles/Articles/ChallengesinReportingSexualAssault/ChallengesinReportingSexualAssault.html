						It’s hard to get accurate statistics on rape because many victims don’t want to share their experience. There are many reasons for this, such as the different ways rape is defined and measured, who is being studied, how long the time frame is, and the way statistics are reported. Victims often face barriers like feeling ashamed, guilty, or embarrassed. They may also worry about how their friends and family will react or fear that no one will believe them. In some cases, victims are scared of being blamed or judged, or they don’t want to ruin their relationship with the person who hurt them (Murphy-Oikonen et al., 2020).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Other reasons victims don’t report rape include the fear of being called a troublemaker or a whistleblower, especially at work or in social settings. Some might be afraid of losing their job or facing personal consequences. A lack of knowledge about how to report the crime or what will happen if they do may also keep someone from speaking up. Additionally, victims might not fully understand the severity of what happened, and they could downplay the abuse or feel responsible for it. Past experiences where they weren’t believed can make them hesitant to report (Polizzi, S., 2015).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						There are also practical reasons victims may not report, such as not having enough emotional or financial support. They might worry about their children’s safety or well-being, which could make them afraid to speak out. Without a safe place to turn, the fear of consequences can leave victims feeling trapped and unable to share their experiences (Morgan, A., Boxall, H., & Payne, J., 2022).
